<h1>Attempting to Clone a Genetic Algorithm Car Simulation: A Tale of Python, AI, and JavaScript</h1>
<h2 id="the-ambitious-goal-from-python-to-the-browser">The Ambitious Goal: From Python to the Browser</h2> <p>As a fun side project, I recently became fascinated with a car simulation that used a genetic algorithm to teach virtual cars how to navigate a track. The original implementation, which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/giaco91/Car-Race---An-evolutionary-Game.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> , was written in Python, and I thought it would be a fantastic challenge to clone it for the web using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. My plan was to leverage AI coding assistants to help with the heavy lifting of translating the Python logic into a functional browser-based experience.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge-of-ai-powered-translation">The Challenge of AI-Powered Translation</h3> <p>I dove in, feeding the Python source code to my AI tools with the prompt to reimplement the simulation in web-friendly languages. My initial hope was that the AI could handle the complex logicâ€”from the physics engine to the core genetic algorithm that selects for &ldquo;fitter&rdquo; cars over generations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the results weren&rsquo;t what I had hoped for. The task proved to be far more complex than a simple line-by-line translation. The AI struggled to grasp the entire context of the project, leading to fragmented, non-working code. It was a humbling experience that highlighted a key reality of AI-assisted development: for large, intricate systems, you can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;throw it over the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This led me to a couple of conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The problem was too big.</strong> Asking an AI to convert an entire complex application in one go is likely to fail. The context is too vast.</li>
<li><strong>I needed to break it down.</strong> A better approach would have been to deconstruct the Python application into its core components (rendering, physics, genetics, UI) and tackle them one by one.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-strategic-pivot-building-on-existing-work">A Strategic Pivot: Building on Existing Work</h3> <p>After hitting a wall with the conversion approach, I decided to pivot. Instead of translating the Python code from scratch, I started searching on GitHub for similar projects already built with JavaScript. I found a few promising repositories that had already solved the fundamental problems of rendering and basic physics in a browser environment.</p>
<p>My new plan is to use one of these existing projects as a foundation. By starting with a working JS implementation, I can focus on understanding, modifying, and improving it, which feels like a much more manageable and rewarding path.</p>
<h2 id="insights-and-next-steps">Insights and Next Steps</h2> <p>This project, despite its initial failure, was a valuable learning experience. It clarified the current limitations of AI for large-scale code conversion and reinforced the importance of solid software engineering principles.</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts on moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deconstruct and Conquer:</strong> I&rsquo;ll start by forking an existing JavaScript car simulation. My first step will be to simply get it running locally and map out its architecture. I need to understand how the code is structured before I can meaningfully change anything.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted AI Assistance:</strong> Instead of asking the AI to build the whole thing, I&rsquo;ll use it for smaller, more focused tasks. For example, I might ask it to &ldquo;refactor this physics function for better readability&rdquo; or &ldquo;write a new JavaScript module for calculating the fitness score based on distance traveled and speed.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Focus on the Algorithm:</strong> My primary interest is in the genetic algorithm itself. Once I have a stable base simulation, I can start experimenting with the core logic. I could try implementing different selection methods (e.g., tournament selection vs. roulette wheel selection) or tweak the mutation rate to see how it affects the cars&rsquo; learning process.</li>
<li><strong>Learn from the Original:</strong> I&rsquo;ll keep the original Python project as a reference. By studying its well-structured logic, I can gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and manually implement them in JavaScript, ensuring I grasp the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind the code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>While my initial attempt to clone a Python simulation using AI didn&rsquo;t succeed, it led me to a more pragmatic and achievable strategy. The key takeaway is that problem decomposition is critical, especially when working with AI tools. Starting with an existing foundation and iterating on it is often a more effective approach than attempting a massive, all-or-nothing conversion. I&rsquo;m excited to dive into the existing JavaScript projects and see if I can build something truly impressive on the shoulders of others.</p>
