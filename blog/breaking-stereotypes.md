Play-Doh is a great way for creative play and sensory exploration, allowing children to develop fine motor skills and express their imagination through molding, shaping, and manipulating the dough. Most people imagine play dough for sculpting and creating shapes.

But did you know that you can use them as electrical conductors and use them to prototype parts and simple circuits for your hobby project? By mixing salt into the dough, it becomes conductive and can be used to create simple circuits and electronic devices. This unconventional use of play dough challenges stereotypes by demonstrating that everyday materials can have practical applications beyond their intended use.

Technical Program Managers (TPMs) are often stereotyped as being more technical than strategic. This stereotype can limit their opportunities for career growth, as they may be seen as being less qualified for roles in product management or engineering. Stereo-typing technical program managers (TPMs) as solely responsible for overseeing the execution of complex software projects can be limiting and overlook their potential to contribute in other areas.

Ultimately, these roles are fluid. By putting on the hat of a Product Manager, a TPM can prioritize work that is more empathetic to end users. By communicating the technical nuances they can simplify the decision making process. Like the play dough, you can discover a new potential that could open up a world of opportunities.

Hereâ€™s a fun exploration of playdough as a touch sensitive button to play games on your phone that I worked on back in 2013 using motocoder.
