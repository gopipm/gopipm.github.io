      <p>
       Every software project begins with an idea. Mine was a desire to create a learning tool inspired by the teaching methods of Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun. I wanted a simple app that would present a new puzzle at the click of a button, but with a twist: it would also provide a detailed solution, explaining the nuances from a naive approach to an optimized one. The goal was to help users recognize underlying algorithmic patterns and improve their problem-solving skills.

       Navigating the AI Coding Revolution
      </h2>
      <p>
       Every week, it seems a new AI-powered coding tool enters the scene, promising to revolutionize our development workflows. As a developer constantly looking to optimize my process, I‚Äôve been diving headfirst into this rapidly evolving ecosystem. From IDE extensions to standalone CLIs, the options are vast and varied.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is my attempt to catalog and compare the various tools I‚Äôve experimented with recently. Many of these tools act as sophisticated frontends, connecting to powerful large language models (LLMs) like those from OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, while others offer a more integrated, unique experience.

       As a fun side project, I recently became fascinated with a car simulation that used a genetic algorithm to teach virtual cars how to navigate a track. The original implementation, which you can find on

       , was written in Python, and I thought it would be a fantastic challenge to clone it for the web using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. My plan was to leverage AI coding assistants to help with the heavy lifting of translating the Python logic into a functional browser-based experience.

       As a Technical Program Manager at Google with a deep passion for technology that stretches back to my first ZX Spectrum, I‚Äôm always looking for ways to blend my professional skills with my personal projects. My latest endeavor? Automating my Hugo-based blog. The ultimate goal is to create a fully autonomous ‚Äúghost writer‚Äù that can generate and publish content regularly. The first major step in this journey has been successfully setting up a workflow using Gemini to generate complete, formatted blog posts, just like this one!

       Getting started with new command-line tools can sometimes feel like a chore, but I was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was to set up the Gemini CLI. As an AI-powered assistant that runs directly in your terminal, it‚Äôs a game-changer for developers, and the setup process is just as streamlined. This post will walk you through the quick installation and initial configuration.

       Before you start, you‚Äôll need to have
       <strong>
        Node.js
       </strong>
       installed on your system. The Gemini CLI requires version 18 or higher. You can verify your version by running
       <code>
        node -v
       </code>
       in your terminal.

       Picture this: it‚Äôs the 1980s, I‚Äôm in 8th grade, and my dad brings home a shiny new ZX Spectrum.
For the uninitiated, this was the Atari of its day, loading games from cassette tapes that
screeched like a digital banshee while colorful lines danced across the screen. I was hooked,
playing Jet Set Willy and Dynamite Dan, but the real magic happened when I borrowed BASIC
programming books from the British Council Library in Bangalore. I dove into ASCII art through
bit manipulation and geeked out over POKE and PEEK commands, poking straight into the
machine‚Äôs memory to make graphics pop. That curiosity to tinker with a computer‚Äôs soul set the
stage for a lifelong love affair with learning.

      </h1>
      <p>
       Play-Doh is a great way for creative play and sensory exploration, allowing children to develop fine motor skills and express their imagination through molding, shaping, and manipulating the dough. Most people imagine play dough for sculpting and creating shapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But did you know that you can use them as electrical conductors and use them to prototype parts and simple circuits for your hobby project? By mixing salt into the dough, it becomes conductive and can be used to create simple circuits and electronic devices. This unconventional use of play dough challenges stereotypes by demonstrating that everyday materials can have practical applications beyond their intended use.

      <p>
       As a Technical Program Manager, patience and humility are critical traits that can help you succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Patience enables you to stay calm and make informed decisions even when faced with unpredictable or stressful situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humility helps you build strong relationships with stakeholders and avoid becoming too attached to your own ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       These two qualities are also closely related, as being humble can make you more patient and open-minded. By cultivating patience and humility, you can become a more effective leader and manage complex projects more successfully.

      <p>
       In 10th grade, I wrote a Pascal program that could generate the source code for another executable program. What fascinated me was that one program could produce another that could run independently. Hence, ‚ÄúGenerating Code.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       I went on to develop a Computer Graphics program for my final project where I would move the cursor on screen and place geometric shapes, record the coordinates and shape types in a data structure, and use that as input to ‚ÄúGenerate code‚Äù that would independently execute and re-draw the original figure.

      </h1>
      <p>
       As kids, we were encouraged to be curious and ask a lot of questions. That‚Äôs how we learned.
Maybe that motivates me to reach out to peers for help or ask for guidance without any inhibitions.
In college, as a back bencher it was fun to ask our teachers questions so they would pause and think themselves for an answer.
At work, as an engineer I asked a lot of questions to navigate complexity, troubleshoot a customer issue.
As a leader, we ask questions to help make decisions, gauge your team engagement and continuously learn from your team.
