Mine was a desire to create a learning tool inspired by the teaching methods of Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun. I wanted a simple app that would present a new puzzle at the click of a button, but with a twist: it would also provide a detailed solution, explaining the nuances from a naive approach to an optimized one. The goal was to help users recognize underlying algorithmic patterns and improve their problem-solving skills.</p><p>This was the seed of the &ldquo;Gen AI Puzzle Solver,&rdquo; a project that would take me on an iterative journey of development, debugging, and refinement. In this post, I&rsquo;ll share the technical story of how this app was built, the challenges I faced, and the key takeaways for anyone looking to build their own applications with Large Language Models (LLMs).</p><h2 id=version-1-the-foundation->Version 1: The Foundation üèóÔ∏è</h2><p>The first version of the app was a simple, single-page HTML file. It used Tailwind CSS for styling and had a basic JavaScript structure for interacting with the Gemini API. The core logic was straightforward: a generatePuzzle function would construct a prompt, send it to the API, and then parse the JSON response to display the puzzle.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaway: Start Small and Iterate</strong></p><p>This initial version was far from perfect, but it was a crucial first step. It allowed me to validate the core concept and get a feel for working with the Gemini API. By starting with a minimal viable product (MVP), I was able to get feedback early and often, which proved to be invaluable as the project evolved.</p><h2 id=version-2-feature-expansion->Version 2: Feature Expansion üöÄ</h2><p>With the basic functionality in place, it was time to start adding features. Based on my own experience using the app, I identified several areas for improvement:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Persistence:</strong> I needed a way to save puzzles so I wouldn&rsquo;t lose them. I implemented this using the browser&rsquo;s localStorage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sharing:</strong> I wanted to be able to share the puzzles with others, so I added social sharing links and a &ldquo;copy as Markdown&rdquo; feature.</p></li><li><p><strong>Algorithm Simulation:</strong> To better understand the solutions, I added a button to display a text-based simulation of the algorithm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keyword-Based Puzzle Generation:</strong> I wanted more control over the types of puzzles that were generated, so I added the ability to input keywords to guide the AI.</p></li><li><p><strong>Configuration:</strong> To make it easier to run the app locally, I moved all the configuration variables into a separate section at the top of the script.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Key Takeaway: The Power of Customization</strong></p><p>Adding these features made the app significantly more powerful and engaging. The ability to customize the puzzles and share them with others transformed it from a simple toy into a valuable learning tool.</p><h2 id=version-3-bug-fixing-and-robustness->Version 3: Bug Fixing and Robustness üêû</h2><p>As the app grew in complexity, I started to encounter bugs. The most significant of these was a race condition where a pending visualization from a previous puzzle could be incorrectly attached to a new one.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaway: The Importance of Bug Management</strong></p><p>This bug highlighted the importance of having a solid bug management process in place. By carefully debugging the issue and implementing a request cancellation mechanism, I was able to fix the bug and make the app more robust.</p><h2 id=version-4-the-final-polish->Version 4: The Final Polish ‚ú®</h2><p>With the major features in place and the most critical bugs fixed, it was time to add the final layer of polish. This included:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Auto-Saving:</strong> I added an auto-save feature to automatically save puzzles after they were generated.</p></li><li><p><strong>Content Regeneration:</strong> I added a &ldquo;Regenerate&rdquo; button to the solution and visualization sections, with an optional feedback field to guide the AI in refining the content.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cultural Customization:</strong> I added a country dropdown menu to customize the puzzle&rsquo;s story and context.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dynamic Illustrations:</strong> I used an image generation API to create and display a unique illustration for each puzzle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Voice Narration:</strong> I added a text-to-speech feature to read the puzzle aloud, with a selection of different voices.</p></li><li><p><strong>Settings Tab:</strong> I moved all the configuration options into a dedicated &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; tab.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Key Takeaway: The Devil is in the Details</strong></p><p>These final touches made a huge difference in the overall user experience. The app felt more polished, professional, and engaging.</p><h2 id=lessons-learned->Lessons Learned üéì</h2><p>This project was a valuable learning experience. Here are some of the key lessons I learned along the way:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Iterative Development is Key:</strong> By starting small and iterating, I was able to build a complex and feature-rich application in a relatively short amount of time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security is Paramount:</strong> I learned the importance of keeping secrets out of the codebase and using a separate file for sensitive information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Localization Matters:</strong> By adding support for different languages and cultural contexts, I was able to make the app accessible to a global audience.</p></li><li><p><strong>LLMs are Powerful, but Not Perfect:</strong> I learned that LLMs can be a powerful tool for generating creative content, but they&rsquo;re not perfect. It&rsquo;s important to have a solid bug management process in place to deal with the inevitable errors and inconsistencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Version Management is a Lifesaver:</strong> When things went wrong, I was always able to go back to a previous working version of the app. This saved me a lot of time and frustration.</p></li></ul><p>I hope this technical story has been helpful. If you&rsquo;re thinking about building your own application with an LLM, I encourage you to jump in and get started. It&rsquo;s a challenging but rewarding experience.</p><h2 id=try-the-app-and-explore-its-features>Try the App and Explore its Features</h2><p>You can try the &ldquo;Gen AI Puzzle Solver&rdquo; app here: <a href="https://gemini.google.com/share/0e45bdacce5d?full-screen=true" target=_blank rel=noopener>https://gemini.google.com/share/0e45bdacce5d?full-screen=true</a></p><p>The app is packed with features designed to provide a rich and engaging learning experience.
