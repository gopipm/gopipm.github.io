As a Technical Program Manager, patience and humility are critical traits that can help you succeed.

Patience enables you to stay calm and make informed decisions even when faced with unpredictable or stressful situations.

Humility helps you build strong relationships with stakeholders and avoid becoming too attached to your own ideas.

These two qualities are also closely related, as being humble can make you more patient and open-minded. By cultivating patience and humility, you can become a more effective leader and manage complex projects more successfully.
