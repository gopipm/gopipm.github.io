For the uninitiated, this was the Atari of its day, loading games from cassette tapes that
screeched like a digital banshee while colorful lines danced across the screen. I was hooked,
playing Jet Set Willy and Dynamite Dan, but the real magic happened when I borrowed BASIC
programming books from the British Council Library in Bangalore. I dove into ASCII art through
bit manipulation and geeked out over POKE and PEEK commands, poking straight into the
machine’s memory to make graphics pop. That curiosity to tinker with a computer’s soul set the
stage for a lifelong love affair with learning.</p><p>Fast forward to high school, where I joined Aptech coaching classes, mastering C, Pascal,
Fortran, and dipping my toes into SQL and relational databases. I never pursued a formal
computer science degree, but I was captivated by machines creating art. I wrote C programs to
render spinning, scaling 3D geometric shapes, marveling at their motion. Then came an “aha!”
moment: I discovered a program could generate another program’s source code. Using mouse
inputs to position objects, I’d capture coordinates and output new code to draw them. It was like
giving birth to digital creations, sparking questions about what else I could make machines do.</p><p>In undergrad and grad school, I leveled up with Perl, C++, and assembly, even programming a
CRT for a quirky “Apple Catch” game—my first dance with embedded systems. Those skills
landed me at Motorola, where I worked on the EMX cellular switch, powered by a beefy Z8k
processor (a grown-up cousin of the ZX Spectrum’s Z80). Picture a three-car-garage-sized
beast of racks and computers, built for fault tolerance. I debugged live systems and
implemented high-speed packet-switched data in the pre-2G analog days. When KDDI shifted
to digital, I knew it was time to pivot and learn anew.</p><p>By 2001, I was deep in Unix and Linux, assembling my own PC with 512MB RAM and a 20GB
hard drive, building gcc toolchains and Linux kernels from scratch—no GUIs, just raw curiosity.
At Motorola Mobility, I joined a 15-person team crafting a Linux Java platform for next-gen
mobile devices using Intel XScale processors. Working on filesystems like squashfs and power
management with wake locks was mind-blowing—tiny devices in your palm outpacing those
garage-sized switches.</p><p>When Android emerged, I worked on early Verizon Droid phones, diving into Python and Django
for log parsing and sentiment analysis of dogfood data. My techy heart stayed alive outside
work, experimenting with phones for robotics. At Google’s ATAP, I prototyped with Arduino and
Raspberry Pi, building a picture frame powered by a phone screen that vibrated based on
accelerometer data from another device, cobbled together via Twitter and Gmail exports. It was
hacky, fun, and taught me the limits and possibilities of end-to-end system integration.</p><p>In 2011, Stanford’s MOOC on Artificial Intelligence by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig blew
my mind. It felt like the education I’d missed in college. I binged MOOCs on edX, Udacity, and
Coursera—physics, Python, algorithms, cloud tech, and robotics. I dove into Robot Operating
System (ROS), building robots and applying Kalman and particle filters for SLAM and
autonomous driving. That learning fueled a startup I co-founded, architecting a patient
management system using Google Cloud Platform skills, teaching me the gritty realities of
product-market fit.</p><p>At Google, I soaked up cross-functional wisdom as a Technical Program Manager, mastering
risk management, power optimization for VR headsets, and release processes for millions of
Wi-Fi and camera devices. But the learning never stops. Enter AI—my tireless coworker who
answers fundamental questions without judgment. I built an app that maps learning
dependencies for any topic, letting me navigate abstractions and master new skills like
LangGraph, LangChain, and RAG. Last week, I spun up my first MCP server, and I’m still
catching up, using AI to generate boilerplate code or entire apps, freeing my mind to focus on
user impact and stellar first-version experiences.</p><p>From cassette tapes to AI, my journey’s been about staying flexible, embracing new tech as the
old fades, and starting from scratch out of necessity, interest, and sheer curiosity. Whether it’s
POKE commands or fine-tuning LLMs, learning is my greatest asset—one no one can take
away.</p><p>So, stay curious. Start small. Tinker with the tools at your fingertips. The tech will evolve, but an
open mind keeps you ahead. What’s the next thing you’re curious about? Let’s keep learning
together!</p><div class=footer><p>&copy; Gopi Palaniappan. Powered by
