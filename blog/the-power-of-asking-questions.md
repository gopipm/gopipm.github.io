As kids, we were encouraged to be curious and ask a lot of questions. That's how we learned.
Maybe that motivates me to reach out to peers for help or ask for guidance without any inhibitions.
In college, as a back bencher it was fun to ask our teachers questions so they would pause and think themselves for an answer.
At work, as an engineer I asked a lot of questions to navigate complexity, troubleshoot a customer issue.
As a leader, we ask questions to help make decisions, gauge your team engagement and continuously learn from your team.

While there is no good or bad questions...you can always improve the velocity of insights by asking the right contextual questions so you don't get distracted or get stuck in some local maxima/minima.

In the new #ai era, Prompt engineering is a great skill to have to ask or frame the right questions for an insight you are interested in. I think there is a huge scope to improve your asking questions ability by iterating on prompts to achieve a result and evaluating the quality of the prompt to the results to gauge how good your questions are.

Short term, the tools are error prone and not yet sophisticated but over time, it would get better... and asking questions is something that is not going away anytime soon...

Stay hungry!!! Stay foolish!!! Ask questions!!!
