Getting started with new command-line tools can sometimes feel like a chore, but I was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was to set up the Gemini CLI. As an AI-powered assistant that runs directly in your terminal, it's a game-changer for developers, and the setup process is just as streamlined. This post will walk you through the quick installation and initial configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need to have **Node.js** installed on your system. The Gemini CLI requires version 18 or higher. You can verify your version by running `node -v` in your terminal.

## Installation: A Single Command

The easiest way to get the Gemini CLI running is by using `npx`, which executes a package without installing it globally. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to install it globally to run it from anywhere with the simple `gemini` command, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

## Initial Configuration

The first time you run the tool, it will guide you through a brief, interactive setup.

1.  **Launch the CLI:** If you installed it globally, just type `gemini`. Otherwise, use the `npx` command again.
2.  **Authentication:** You'll be prompted to sign in with your Google account. This is the most straightforward method and provides a generous free tier with access to the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, a 1 million token context window, and up to 1,000 requests per day.
3.  **Choose a Theme:** You can select a color theme for the CLI's interface.

That's it\! Once authenticated, you are ready to start interacting with the AI directly from your command line.

## Basic Usage

You can now start making requests. For example, to get a summary of a file in your current directory, you could type:

```bash
> Summarize the file @my-document.txt
```

The CLI also supports a range of built-in tools for interacting with your file system, searching the web, and more.

## Conclusion

The Gemini CLI is a powerful tool that brings the capabilities of Google's advanced AI models directly into the developer's workflow. The setup is incredibly straightforward, removing any significant barrier to entry. In just a few minutes, you can have a sophisticated AI assistant running in your terminal, ready to help with coding, analysis, and more.
