      <title>Effortless Setup: Get Started with the Gemini CLI in Minutes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting started with new command-line tools can sometimes feel like a chore, but I was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was to set up the Gemini CLI. As an AI-powered assistant that runs directly in your terminal, it&amp;rsquo;s a game-changer for developers, and the setup process is just as streamlined. This post will walk you through the quick installation and initial configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before you start, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to have &lt;strong&gt;Node.js&lt;/strong&gt; installed on your system. The Gemini CLI requires version 18 or higher. You can verify your version by running &lt;code&gt;node -v&lt;/code&gt; in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent some time today setting up and playing with a new tool, and I&amp;rsquo;m genuinely impressed. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Crush&lt;/a&gt; , a new command-line interface for interacting with large language models from the brilliant minds at Charm Bracelet. The experience was so smooth that I had to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-beautiful-interface-for-all-the-models&#34;&gt;A Beautiful Interface for All the Models&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first thing that strikes you about &lt;code&gt;crush&lt;/code&gt; is its beautiful, intuitive interface. It lives in your terminal but feels incredibly modern and responsive. Getting started was a breeze. I already had a Gemini API key, so I plugged that in to get access to &lt;strong&gt;Gemini 2.5 Pro&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
