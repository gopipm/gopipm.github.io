The original implementation, which you can find on &lt;a href="https://github.com/giaco91/Car-Race---An-evolutionary-Game.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub&lt;/a> , was written in Python, and I thought it would be a fantastic challenge to clone it for the web using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. My plan was to leverage AI coding assistants to help with the heavy lifting of translating the Python logic into a functional browser-based experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automating My Blog: Using Gemini to Generate Hugo Posts</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/hugo-blog-post-creator-gems/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/hugo-blog-post-creator-gems/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-quest-for-an-automated-ghost-writer">The Quest for an Automated Ghost Writer&lt;/h2> &lt;p>As a Technical Program Manager at Google with a deep passion for technology that stretches back to my first ZX Spectrum, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for ways to blend my professional skills with my personal projects. My latest endeavor? Automating my Hugo-based blog. The ultimate goal is to create a fully autonomous &amp;ldquo;ghost writer&amp;rdquo; that can generate and publish content regularly. The first major step in this journey has been successfully setting up a workflow using Gemini to generate complete, formatted blog posts, just like this one!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World in Many Languages</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/000-hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/000-hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-global-greeting-card">&lt;strong>A Global Greeting Card&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3> &lt;p>This project is a simple yet elegant demonstration of one of the most fundamental concepts in programming and global communication: &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo;. Generated with the help of Gemini, this webpage presents the iconic greeting in a diverse array of world languages, from Spanish to Hindi to Japanese.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each greeting is displayed on its own clean, well-defined card, making for a pleasant and easy-to-read layout. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic visual representation of how the same simple idea can be expressed across different cultures and scripts. The project serves as a perfect starting point for exploring web typography and internationalization (i18n).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World in Many Languages</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/projects/001-hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/projects/001-hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-global-greeting-card">&lt;strong>A Global Greeting Card&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3> &lt;p>This project is a simple yet elegant demonstration of one of the most fundamental concepts in programming and global communication: &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo;.

You are presented with a simple car (our &amp;ldquo;robot&amp;rdquo;) on a track. Its goal? To learn how to navigate the track on its own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By clicking &amp;ldquo;Train&amp;rdquo;, you can watch as the robot begins its learning process through trial and error. It explores the environment, occasionally making mistakes, but gradually building a &amp;ldquo;brain&amp;rdquo; or a policy that guides it toward successful navigation. Once trained, you can &amp;ldquo;Test&amp;rdquo; its knowledge and watch it drive flawlessly. The simulation even allows you to save this learned model, demonstrating the concept of persisting a trained AI. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful, visual demonstration of how a machine can learn from experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/projects/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/projects/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
