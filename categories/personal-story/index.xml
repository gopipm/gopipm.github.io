What fascinated me was that one program could produce another that could run independently. Hence, &amp;ldquo;Generating Code.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went on to develop a Computer Graphics program for my final project where I would move the cursor on screen and place geometric shapes, record the coordinates and shape types in a data structure, and use that as input to &amp;ldquo;Generate code&amp;rdquo; that would independently execute and re-draw the original figure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Embracing Curiosity: My Lifelong Journey of Learning to Learn</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/embracing-curiosity-learning-journey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/embracing-curiosity-learning-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p>Picture this: it’s the 1980s, I’m in 8th grade, and my dad brings home a shiny new ZX Spectrum.
For the uninitiated, this was the Atari of its day, loading games from cassette tapes that
screeched like a digital banshee while colorful lines danced across the screen. I was hooked,
playing Jet Set Willy and Dynamite Dan, but the real magic happened when I borrowed BASIC
programming books from the British Council Library in Bangalore. I dove into ASCII art through
bit manipulation and geeked out over POKE and PEEK commands, poking straight into the
machine’s memory to make graphics pop. That curiosity to tinker with a computer’s soul set the
stage for a lifelong love affair with learning.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
