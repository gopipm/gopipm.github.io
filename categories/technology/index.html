What fascinated me was that one program could produce another that could run independently. Hence, &ldquo;Generating Code.&rdquo;</p><p>I went on to develop a Computer Graphics program for my final project where I would move the cursor on screen and place geometric shapes, record the coordinates and shape types in a data structure, and use that as input to &ldquo;Generate code&rdquo; that would independently execute and re-draw the original figure.</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Aug. 6, 2023</div><h1><a href=https://gopipm.github.io/blog/breaking-stereotypes/ title="Breaking Stereotypes: From Play-Doh to Program Management">Breaking Stereotypes: From Play-Doh to Program Management</a></h1><p>Play-Doh is a great way for creative play and sensory exploration, allowing children to develop fine motor skills and express their imagination through molding, shaping, and manipulating the dough. Most people imagine play dough for sculpting and creating shapes.</p><p>But did you know that you can use them as electrical conductors and use them to prototype parts and simple circuits for your hobby project? By mixing salt into the dough, it becomes conductive and can be used to create simple circuits and electronic devices. This unconventional use of play dough challenges stereotypes by demonstrating that everyday materials can have practical applications beyond their intended use.</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Jul. 7, 2025</div><h1><a href=https://gopipm.github.io/blog/embracing-curiosity-learning-journey/ title="Embracing Curiosity: My Lifelong Journey of Learning to Learn">Embracing Curiosity: My Lifelong Journey of Learning to Learn</a></h1><p>Picture this: it’s the 1980s, I’m in 8th grade, and my dad brings home a shiny new ZX Spectrum.
For the uninitiated, this was the Atari of its day, loading games from cassette tapes that
screeched like a digital banshee while colorful lines danced across the screen. I was hooked,
playing Jet Set Willy and Dynamite Dan, but the real magic happened when I borrowed BASIC
programming books from the British Council Library in Bangalore. I dove into ASCII art through
bit manipulation and geeked out over POKE and PEEK commands, poking straight into the
machine’s memory to make graphics pop. That curiosity to tinker with a computer’s soul set the
stage for a lifelong love affair with learning.</p></p></div><div class=post><p><div class=date>Feb. 2, 2023</div><h1><a href=https://gopipm.github.io/blog/the-power-of-asking-questions/ title="Stay Curious: The Timeless Power of Asking Questions">Stay Curious: The Timeless Power of Asking Questions</a></h1><p>As kids, we were encouraged to be curious and ask a lot of questions. That&rsquo;s how we learned.
Maybe that motivates me to reach out to peers for help or ask for guidance without any inhibitions.
In college, as a back bencher it was fun to ask our teachers questions so they would pause and think themselves for an answer.
At work, as an engineer I asked a lot of questions to navigate complexity, troubleshoot a customer issue.
As a leader, we ask questions to help make decisions, gauge your team engagement and continuously learn from your team.</p></p></div></div><div class=footer><p>&copy; Gopi Palaniappan. Powered by
