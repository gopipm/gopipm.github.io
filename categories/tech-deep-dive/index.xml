      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ambitious-goal-from-python-to-the-browser&#34;&gt;The Ambitious Goal: From Python to the Browser&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a fun side project, I recently became fascinated with a car simulation that used a genetic algorithm to teach virtual cars how to navigate a track. The original implementation, which you can find on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/giaco91/Car-Race---An-evolutionary-Game.git&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; , was written in Python, and I thought it would be a fantastic challenge to clone it for the web using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. My plan was to leverage AI coding assistants to help with the heavy lifting of translating the Python logic into a functional browser-based experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-quest-for-an-automated-ghost-writer&#34;&gt;The Quest for an Automated Ghost Writer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a Technical Program Manager at Google with a deep passion for technology that stretches back to my first ZX Spectrum, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for ways to blend my professional skills with my personal projects. My latest endeavor? Automating my Hugo-based blog. The ultimate goal is to create a fully autonomous &amp;ldquo;ghost writer&amp;rdquo; that can generate and publish content regularly. The first major step in this journey has been successfully setting up a workflow using Gemini to generate complete, formatted blog posts, just like this one!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
