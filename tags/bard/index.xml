What fascinated me was that one program could produce another that could run independently. Hence, &amp;ldquo;Generating Code.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went on to develop a Computer Graphics program for my final project where I would move the cursor on screen and place geometric shapes, record the coordinates and shape types in a data structure, and use that as input to &amp;ldquo;Generate code&amp;rdquo; that would independently execute and re-draw the original figure.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
