It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crush&lt;/a> , a new command-line interface for interacting with large language models from the brilliant minds at Charm Bracelet. The experience was so smooth that I had to write about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-beautiful-interface-for-all-the-models">A Beautiful Interface for All the Models&lt;/h2> &lt;p>The first thing that strikes you about &lt;code>crush&lt;/code> is its beautiful, intuitive interface. It lives in your terminal but feels incredibly modern and responsive. Getting started was a breeze. I already had a Gemini API key, so I plugged that in to get access to &lt;strong>Gemini 2.5 Pro&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
