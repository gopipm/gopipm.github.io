&lt;h2 id="the-genesis-of-an-idea-">The Genesis of an Idea 💡&lt;/h2> &lt;p>Every software project begins with an idea. Mine was a desire to create a learning tool inspired by the teaching methods of Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun. I wanted a simple app that would present a new puzzle at the click of a button, but with a twist: it would also provide a detailed solution, explaining the nuances from a naive approach to an optimized one. The goal was to help users recognize underlying algorithmic patterns and improve their problem-solving skills.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
