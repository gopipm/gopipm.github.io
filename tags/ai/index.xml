      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-glimpse-into-machine-learning&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Glimpse into Machine Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This fascinating project provides an interactive window into the world of artificial intelligence, specifically &lt;strong&gt;reinforcement learning&lt;/strong&gt;. You are presented with a simple car (our &amp;ldquo;robot&amp;rdquo;) on a track. Its goal? To learn how to navigate the track on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By clicking &amp;ldquo;Train&amp;rdquo;, you can watch as the robot begins its learning process through trial and error. It explores the environment, occasionally making mistakes, but gradually building a &amp;ldquo;brain&amp;rdquo; or a policy that guides it toward successful navigation. Once trained, you can &amp;ldquo;Test&amp;rdquo; its knowledge and watch it drive flawlessly. The simulation even allows you to save this learned model, demonstrating the concept of persisting a trained AI. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful, visual demonstration of how a machine can learn from experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My First Crush: Effortless Multi-Model AI in the Terminal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent some time today setting up and playing with a new tool, and I&amp;rsquo;m genuinely impressed. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Crush&lt;/a&gt; , a new command-line interface for interacting with large language models from the brilliant minds at Charm Bracelet. The experience was so smooth that I had to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-beautiful-interface-for-all-the-models&#34;&gt;A Beautiful Interface for All the Models&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first thing that strikes you about &lt;code&gt;crush&lt;/code&gt; is its beautiful, intuitive interface. It lives in your terminal but feels incredibly modern and responsive. Getting started was a breeze. I already had a Gemini API key, so I plugged that in to get access to &lt;strong&gt;Gemini 2.5 Pro&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
