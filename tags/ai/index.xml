      <description>A Glimpse into Machine Learning This fascinating project provides an interactive window into the world of artificial intelligence, specifically reinforcement learning. You are presented with a simple car (our &amp;ldquo;robot&amp;rdquo;) on a track. Its goal? To learn how to navigate the track on its own.
By clicking &amp;ldquo;Train&amp;rdquo;, you can watch as the robot begins its learning process through trial and error. It explores the environment, occasionally making mistakes, but gradually building a &amp;ldquo;brain&amp;rdquo; or a policy that guides it toward successful navigation.</description>
