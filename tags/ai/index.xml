For the uninitiated, this was the Atari of its day, loading games from cassette tapes that
screeched like a digital banshee while colorful lines danced across the screen. I was hooked,
playing Jet Set Willy and Dynamite Dan, but the real magic happened when I borrowed BASIC
programming books from the British Council Library in Bangalore. I dove into ASCII art through
bit manipulation and geeked out over POKE and PEEK commands, poking straight into the
machine’s memory to make graphics pop. That curiosity to tinker with a computer’s soul set the
stage for a lifelong love affair with learning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interactive Self-Learning Robot</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/projects/003-self-learning-robot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/projects/003-self-learning-robot/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-glimpse-into-machine-learning">&lt;strong>A Glimpse into Machine Learning&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3> &lt;p>This fascinating project provides an interactive window into the world of artificial intelligence, specifically &lt;strong>reinforcement learning&lt;/strong>. You are presented with a simple car (our &amp;ldquo;robot&amp;rdquo;) on a track. Its goal? To learn how to navigate the track on its own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By clicking &amp;ldquo;Train&amp;rdquo;, you can watch as the robot begins its learning process through trial and error. It explores the environment, occasionally making mistakes, but gradually building a &amp;ldquo;brain&amp;rdquo; or a policy that guides it toward successful navigation. Once trained, you can &amp;ldquo;Test&amp;rdquo; its knowledge and watch it drive flawlessly. The simulation even allows you to save this learned model, demonstrating the concept of persisting a trained AI. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful, visual demonstration of how a machine can learn from experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My First Crush: Effortless Multi-Model AI in the Terminal</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/coding-with-crush/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/coding-with-crush/</guid><description>&lt;p>I spent some time today setting up and playing with a new tool, and I&amp;rsquo;m genuinely impressed. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crush&lt;/a> , a new command-line interface for interacting with large language models from the brilliant minds at Charm Bracelet. The experience was so smooth that I had to write about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-beautiful-interface-for-all-the-models">A Beautiful Interface for All the Models&lt;/h2> &lt;p>The first thing that strikes you about &lt;code>crush&lt;/code> is its beautiful, intuitive interface. It lives in your terminal but feels incredibly modern and responsive. Getting started was a breeze. I already had a Gemini API key, so I plugged that in to get access to &lt;strong>Gemini 2.5 Pro&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stay Curious: The Timeless Power of Asking Questions</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/the-power-of-asking-questions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/the-power-of-asking-questions/</guid><description>&lt;p>As kids, we were encouraged to be curious and ask a lot of questions. That&amp;rsquo;s how we learned.
Maybe that motivates me to reach out to peers for help or ask for guidance without any inhibitions.
In college, as a back bencher it was fun to ask our teachers questions so they would pause and think themselves for an answer.
At work, as an engineer I asked a lot of questions to navigate complexity, troubleshoot a customer issue.
As a leader, we ask questions to help make decisions, gauge your team engagement and continuously learn from your team.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
