What fascinated me was that one program could produce another that could run independently. Hence, &amp;ldquo;Generating Code.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went on to develop a Computer Graphics program for my final project where I would move the cursor on screen and place geometric shapes, record the coordinates and shape types in a data structure, and use that as input to &amp;ldquo;Generate code&amp;rdquo; that would independently execute and re-draw the original figure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Attempting to Clone a Genetic Algorithm Car Simulation: A Tale of Python, AI, and JavaScript</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/converting-python-car-sim-to-html-js/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/converting-python-car-sim-to-html-js/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-ambitious-goal-from-python-to-the-browser">The Ambitious Goal: From Python to the Browser&lt;/h2> &lt;p>As a fun side project, I recently became fascinated with a car simulation that used a genetic algorithm to teach virtual cars how to navigate a track. The original implementation, which you can find on &lt;a href="https://github.com/giaco91/Car-Race---An-evolutionary-Game.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub&lt;/a> , was written in Python, and I thought it would be a fantastic challenge to clone it for the web using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. My plan was to leverage AI coding assistants to help with the heavy lifting of translating the Python logic into a functional browser-based experience.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
