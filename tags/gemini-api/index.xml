My latest endeavor? Automating my Hugo-based blog. The ultimate goal is to create a fully autonomous &amp;ldquo;ghost writer&amp;rdquo; that can generate and publish content regularly. The first major step in this journey has been successfully setting up a workflow using Gemini to generate complete, formatted blog posts, just like this one!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Effortless Setup: Get Started with the Gemini CLI in Minutes</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/geminicli/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/geminicli/</guid><description>&lt;p>Getting started with new command-line tools can sometimes feel like a chore, but I was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was to set up the Gemini CLI. As an AI-powered assistant that runs directly in your terminal, it&amp;rsquo;s a game-changer for developers, and the setup process is just as streamlined. This post will walk you through the quick installation and initial configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites&lt;/h2> &lt;p>Before you start, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to have &lt;strong>Node.js&lt;/strong> installed on your system. The Gemini CLI requires version 18 or higher. You can verify your version by running &lt;code>node -v&lt;/code> in your terminal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My First Crush: Effortless Multi-Model AI in the Terminal</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/coding-with-crush/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/coding-with-crush/</guid><description>&lt;p>I spent some time today setting up and playing with a new tool, and I&amp;rsquo;m genuinely impressed. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crush&lt;/a> , a new command-line interface for interacting with large language models from the brilliant minds at Charm Bracelet. The experience was so smooth that I had to write about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-beautiful-interface-for-all-the-models">A Beautiful Interface for All the Models&lt;/h2> &lt;p>The first thing that strikes you about &lt;code>crush&lt;/code> is its beautiful, intuitive interface. It lives in your terminal but feels incredibly modern and responsive. Getting started was a breeze. I already had a Gemini API key, so I plugged that in to get access to &lt;strong>Gemini 2.5 Pro&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
