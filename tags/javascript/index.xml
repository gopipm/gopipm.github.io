The original implementation, which you can find on &lt;a href="https://github.com/giaco91/Car-Race---An-evolutionary-Game.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub&lt;/a> , was written in Python, and I thought it would be a fantastic challenge to clone it for the web using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. My plan was to leverage AI coding assistants to help with the heavy lifting of translating the Python logic into a functional browser-based experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Classic Apple Catch Game</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/projects/002-apple-catch/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/projects/002-apple-catch/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-fun-fast-paced-arcade-game">&lt;strong>A Fun, Fast-Paced Arcade Game&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3> &lt;p>Get ready for some classic arcade fun with &amp;ldquo;Apple Catch&amp;rdquo;! This charming game challenges your reflexes with a simple, addictive goal: move the basket at the bottom of the screen to catch the red apples as they fall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The controls are intuitive â€“ just move your mouse left and right to guide the basket. Each apple you successfully catch adds to your score, which is proudly displayed in the top-left corner. But be careful! The game ends the moment you miss an apple, resetting your score to zero. It&amp;rsquo;s a delightful test of focus and a perfect way to take a quick break.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Idea to MVP: A Technical Journey Building a Gen AI App</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/technicaljourneybuildingagenaiapp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/technicaljourneybuildingagenaiapp/</guid><description>&lt;p>A software engineer&amp;rsquo;s logbook on the iterative process of creating a feature-rich web application with a Large Language Model, highlighting the key lessons learned along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-genesis-of-an-idea-">The Genesis of an Idea ðŸ’¡&lt;/h2> &lt;p>Every software project begins with an idea. Mine was a desire to create a learning tool inspired by the teaching methods of Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun. I wanted a simple app that would present a new puzzle at the click of a button, but with a twist: it would also provide a detailed solution, explaining the nuances from a naive approach to an optimized one. The goal was to help users recognize underlying algorithmic patterns and improve their problem-solving skills.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interactive Self-Learning Robot</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/projects/003-self-learning-robot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/projects/003-self-learning-robot/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-glimpse-into-machine-learning">&lt;strong>A Glimpse into Machine Learning&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3> &lt;p>This fascinating project provides an interactive window into the world of artificial intelligence, specifically &lt;strong>reinforcement learning&lt;/strong>. You are presented with a simple car (our &amp;ldquo;robot&amp;rdquo;) on a track. Its goal? To learn how to navigate the track on its own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By clicking &amp;ldquo;Train&amp;rdquo;, you can watch as the robot begins its learning process through trial and error. It explores the environment, occasionally making mistakes, but gradually building a &amp;ldquo;brain&amp;rdquo; or a policy that guides it toward successful navigation. Once trained, you can &amp;ldquo;Test&amp;rdquo; its knowledge and watch it drive flawlessly. The simulation even allows you to save this learned model, demonstrating the concept of persisting a trained AI. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful, visual demonstration of how a machine can learn from experience.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
