What fascinated me was that one program could produce another that could run independently. Hence, &amp;ldquo;Generating Code.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went on to develop a Computer Graphics program for my final project where I would move the cursor on screen and place geometric shapes, record the coordinates and shape types in a data structure, and use that as input to &amp;ldquo;Generate code&amp;rdquo; that would independently execute and re-draw the original figure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Idea to MVP: A Technical Journey Building a Gen AI App</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/technicaljourneybuildingagenaiapp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/technicaljourneybuildingagenaiapp/</guid><description>&lt;p>A software engineer&amp;rsquo;s logbook on the iterative process of creating a feature-rich web application with a Large Language Model, highlighting the key lessons learned along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-genesis-of-an-idea-">The Genesis of an Idea ðŸ’¡&lt;/h2> &lt;p>Every software project begins with an idea. Mine was a desire to create a learning tool inspired by the teaching methods of Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun. I wanted a simple app that would present a new puzzle at the click of a button, but with a twist: it would also provide a detailed solution, explaining the nuances from a naive approach to an optimized one. The goal was to help users recognize underlying algorithmic patterns and improve their problem-solving skills.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
