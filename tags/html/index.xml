&lt;h2 id="the-genesis-of-an-idea-">The Genesis of an Idea ðŸ’¡&lt;/h2> &lt;p>Every software project begins with an idea. Mine was a desire to create a learning tool inspired by the teaching methods of Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun. I wanted a simple app that would present a new puzzle at the click of a button, but with a twist: it would also provide a detailed solution, explaining the nuances from a naive approach to an optimized one. The goal was to help users recognize underlying algorithmic patterns and improve their problem-solving skills.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World in Many Languages</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/000-hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/blog/000-hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-global-greeting-card">&lt;strong>A Global Greeting Card&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3> &lt;p>This project is a simple yet elegant demonstration of one of the most fundamental concepts in programming and global communication: &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo;. Generated with the help of Gemini, this webpage presents the iconic greeting in a diverse array of world languages, from Spanish to Hindi to Japanese.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each greeting is displayed on its own clean, well-defined card, making for a pleasant and easy-to-read layout. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic visual representation of how the same simple idea can be expressed across different cultures and scripts. The project serves as a perfect starting point for exploring web typography and internationalization (i18n).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World in Many Languages</title><link>https://gopipm.github.io/projects/001-hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gopipm.github.io/projects/001-hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="a-global-greeting-card">&lt;strong>A Global Greeting Card&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3> &lt;p>This project is a simple yet elegant demonstration of one of the most fundamental concepts in programming and global communication: &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo;.
